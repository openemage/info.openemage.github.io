# The Modular Lab Movement

Traditional scientific careers are locked within hierarchical structures. Young, innovative researchers often spend years waiting for institutional approval to independently pursue their ideas. The Modular Lab Movement proposes an alternative—a flexible, open, and decentralized model that empowers researchers from the very start of their scientific careers.

The Modular Lab Movement introduces the **"Modular Lab"** as the primary operational unit for scientific inquiry and collaboration, anchored in electron imaging and leveraging shared, centralized resources. Modular Labs operate under the nonprofit meta-institution, **openemage**, which provides governance, legal identity, and infrastructure.

## The Modular Lab

### Science Without Borders

We reject the notion that institutional affiliation is the sole gateway to scientific legitimacy. Science must transcend walls—physical and institutional. Modular Labs offer a pathway for researchers to launch immediately into independent investigation, bypassing traditional institutional barriers.

### Empowerment from Day One

The scientific ecosystem must evolve to allow young and early-career researchers to explore their ideas freely, establishing their scientific identities from the onset of their careers. Modular Labs enable radical first-author empowerment, creating opportunities for researchers to lead independently, without waiting for hierarchical recognition.

### Shared Resources, Local Ideas

Scientific infrastructure should be shared, open, and accessible. National electron microscopy centers, regional imaging nodes, cloud computing, and mobile sample preparation labs form the backbone of a decentralized but collaborative model, where physical ownership of equipment is replaced by service-based access.

### Horizontal Collaboration

Science thrives when ideas flow freely across equal, peer-driven labs. Modular Labs facilitate horizontal collaboration and flexible affiliations, promoting federated ecosystems of researchers who collaborate as equals rather than subordinates.

### Open by Default

Openness is the default operating system. Modular Labs commit to open-access data, open-source code, shared protocols, and transparent methodologies, making scientific research truly reproducible and broadly beneficial.

## Founding Principles

1. **Modular Labs as Primary Scientific Units**  
   - Independently led, portable research units.  
   - Legally and administratively supported by nonprofit entities.  
   - Operating through shared resources, cloud infrastructure, and collaborative networks.

2. **Radical Empowerment of Early-Career Scientists**  
   - Immediate scientific independence without waiting for traditional career milestones.  
   - Ownership and intellectual freedom from the outset.

3. **Post-Institutional Affiliations**  
   - Flexible, multi-institutional, and collaborative affiliations.  
   - Access to centralized electron microscopy and computing resources as external users.

4. **Centralized Infrastructure, Decentralized Ideas**  
   - Use centralized electron microscopy cores and cloud computing.  
   - Maintain intellectual autonomy while leveraging shared infrastructures.

5. **Nonprofit-First Governance**  
   - Nonprofit legal structure supporting scientific innovation and administrative flexibility.  
   - Transparent, integrity-driven governance and financial management.

6. **Horizontal, Peer-to-Peer Collaborations**  
   - Federated lab ecosystems without rigid hierarchies.  
   - Flexible roles: founders, affiliates, visiting scientists, and collaborative researchers.

7. **Openness as Integrity**  
   - Mandatory open-access publications, data, methodologies, and code.  
   - Commitment to transparency, reproducibility, and broad dissemination.

## Sustainability and Lifecycle

Modular Labs are designed not only to initiate early scientific leadership, but to support long-term career development through a phased and adaptable model.

### Transition Pathways

Modular Labs serve as launchpads—allowing scientists to prove their ideas and leadership. Once established through external validation (e.g., impactful publications, tool adoption, grant success), founders can:

- Transition into traditional faculty positions with stronger leverage.  
- Integrate their modular lab’s mission into institutional settings.  
- Retain modular initiatives under the openemage umbrella as legacy or collaborative nodes.

### Validation Through External Metrics

Sustainability is driven by independent success signals:

- Scientific output (publications, citations, preprints)  
- Community impact (toolkits, protocols, dataset re-use)  
- Collaborations and invited talks  
- Funding success and network visibility

## IP and Data Ownership

In a service-oriented infrastructure model, modular labs retain intellectual property and data rights. With centralized resources used via contracts and paid access, PIs maintain creative and legal ownership of their outputs.

---

## Mentorship Ecosystem

Mentorship is cultivated through:

- Peer-led interactions between modular lab founders  
- Voluntary senior scientific advisors  
- Visiting fellows and embedded residency programs  
- Integration with global mentoring networks

## PhD and Postdoc Engagement

While Modular Labs may defer formal student mentorship, founders can:

- Co-mentor PhD students in collaboration with academic institutions  
- Offer high-impact training to postdocs or research fellows  
- Gradually develop full mentorship structures once transitioned into long-term academic roles

> This ensures training and leadership are not forced prematurely, but emerge as natural extensions of scientific maturity.

## openemage: The Meta-Institution

openemage acts as the nonprofit platform underpinning the Modular Lab Movement. It serves as:

- Employer of modular lab founders and staff  
- Legal and administrative host for grants and contracts  
- Creator of fellowship and affiliate programs  
- Custodian of open protocols, data repositories, and shared imaging toolkits  
- Advocate for policy reform towards funding and supporting post-institutional science

At **openemage**, we are setting the stage for a new era of scientific exploration and leadership. We invite:

- Early-career researchers  
- Experienced scientists  
- Visionary funders  
- Forward-thinking institutions  

...to join us in reshaping the scientific landscape.
